# C/C++/C#
Exercises / problems solved with the help of C/C++/C# languages.
Due to some problems with the old computer and the lack of backup, these are just a few C/C++ exercises that I managed to find on the stick or in the cloud.
As for C#, I also use a SQL (local) database for the project with the banking system.
